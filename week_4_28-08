Week-4 Problems
I. Write SQL Select Statements using Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having clauses for the following queries that retrieve data from university database:
1. Find the maximum and average capacity of buildings in the university.

SQL> select min(budget) from department;

MIN(BUDGET)
-----------
      50000

SQL> select count(title),sum(credits) from course where dept_name='Biology';

COUNT(TITLE) SUM(CREDITS)
------------ ------------
           3           11




4. Find the average salary of instructors in the Computer Science department.

SQL> select avg(salary) from instructor where dept_name='Comp. Sci.';

AVG(SALARY)
-----------
 77333.3333




5. Find the total number of instructors who teach a course in the Spring 2010 semester.




6. Find the average salary in each department.
SQL> select dept_name,avg(salary) from instructor group by dept_name;

DEPT_NAME            AVG(SALARY)
-------------------- -----------
Elec. Eng.                 80000
Physics                    91000
Comp. Sci.            77333.3333
Finance                    85000

History                    61000

7 rows selected.



7. Find the number of instructors in each department who teach a course in the Spring 2010 semester.




8. Find the department name and average salary of the department for only those departments where the average salary of the instructors is more than $42,000.
SQL> select dept_name,count(distinct(i.id)) from instructor i,teaches t where t.id=i.id and semester
='Spring' and year='2010' group by dept_name;

DEPT_NAME            COUNT(DISTINCT(I.ID))
-------------------- ---------------------
Comp. Sci.                               3
Finance                                  1

9. For each course section offered in 2009, find the average total credits (tot_cred) of all students enrolled in the section, if the section had at least 2 students.




10. For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that department. You may assume that every department has at least one instructor.
11. For the student with ID 12345 (or any other value), show the total number of credits scored for all courses (taken by that student). Don't display the
tot_creds value from the student table, you should use SQL aggregation on courses taken by the student.
12. Display the total credits for each of the students, along with the ID of the student; don't bother about the name of the student. (Don't display the
tot_creds value from the student table, you should use SQL aggregation on courses taken by the student. For students who have not registered for any
course, tot_creds should be 0)




II. Write nested queries for answering the following queries that retrieve data from
university database:
1. Find the total number of (distinct) students who have taken course
sections taught by the instructor with ID 110011
SQL>select count(distinct id) from (select ta.id from teaches t,takes ta,course c where t.course_id=c.course_id and t.course_id=ta.course_id and t.id='110011');
COUNT(DISTINCTID)
-----------------
                0




2. Find the names of all instructors whose salary is greater than at least one
instructor in the Biology department
SQL> select name from (select i1.name from instructor i1,instructor i2 where i1.salary>i2.salary and
 i2.dept_name='Biology');

NAME
--------------------
Wu
Einstein
Gold
Katz
Singh
Brandt
Kim

7 rows selected.




3. Find the departments that have the highest average salary.
SQL> SELECT dept_name FROM instructor GROUP BY dept_name having avg(salary)=(SELECT max(avg(salary)) FROM instructor GROUP BY dept_name);

DEPT_NAME
--------------------
Physics




4. Find all the courses taught in the both the Fall 2009 and Spring 2010
semesters
SQL> select course_id from teaches where semester='Fall' and year=2009 and course_id in (select course_id from teaches where semester='Spring' and year=2010);

COURSE_I
--------
CS-101



5. Find all the courses taught in the Fall 2009 semester but not in the Spring
2010 semester.





6. Find all courses taught in both the Fall 2009 semester and in the Spring
2010 semester. (Write correlated nested Query)





7. Find all students who have taken all courses offered in the Biology
department. (Write Correlated nested Query)





8. Find all courses that were offered at most once in 2009.





9. Find all courses that were offered at least twice in 2009”





10. Find the average instructors’ salaries of those departments where the
average salary is greater than $42,000.




11. Find the departments with the maximum budget.
SQL> select dept_name from department where budget in (select max(budget) from department);

DEPT_NAME
--------------------
Finance



12. Find the names of instructors who have not taught any course.




13. Find the IDs and names of all students who have not taken any course
offering before Spring 2009.




14. Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum
salary computed.
